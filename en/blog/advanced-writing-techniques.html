                        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                            Great writing starts with great ideas. However, inspiration often comes suddenly, and without a systematic collection mechanism, many valuable creative ideas slip away quietly. Establishing a complete inspiration collection system is the first step in efficient writing.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Implementation Methods:</h3>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                            <li><strong>Multi-platform synchronized note system</strong>: Use tools like Notion, Obsidian, or Evernote to ensure you can record ideas on any device</li>
                            <li><strong>Categorized tagging system</strong>: Create tags for different types of inspiration such as "Tech Articles," "Life Insights," "Business Observations"</li>
                            <li><strong>Regular organization mechanism</strong>: Spend 30 minutes weekly organizing collected inspiration and converting it into specific writing plans</li>
                            <li><strong>Multi-channel input</strong>: Gather inspiration from reading, podcasts, conversations, observations, and other sources</li>
                        </ul>

                                Use voice recording features to quickly capture inspiration. During commutes, exercise, or walks, many good ideas emerge naturally, and voice recording is faster and more natural than typing.

                        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                            Taking time for content planning before starting to write is key to improving writing efficiency. Mind maps are one of the most effective planning tools, helping you organize thoughts clearly and avoid confusion and repetition during the writing process.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Three Levels of Mind Mapping:</h3>

                            <li><strong>Theme Level</strong>: The core topic of the article, usually placed at the center of the mind map</li>
                            <li><strong>Section Level</strong>: Main content blocks, major branches extending from the theme</li>
                            <li><strong>Point Level</strong>: Specific points and supporting materials under each section</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                            Using digital mind mapping tools like MindMeister, XMind, or the free Coggle makes your planning process more flexible and efficient. These tools support multimedia insertion, collaborative editing, and export functions, perfectly suited for modern writers' needs.

                        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                            Writing requires high levels of concentration, but various distractions in modern life often make it difficult to enter a deep work state. The Pomodoro Technique is a simple yet effective time management method particularly suitable for writing tasks.

                            Many writers pursue perfection during the drafting stage, which often leads to slow progress and creative blocks. Learning to draft quickly is an important skill for improving writing efficiency, helping you overcome perfectionist constraints and rapidly convert ideas into text.

                            <li><strong>Ignore details</strong>: Leave grammar, spelling, and formatting issues for the editing phase</li>
                            <li><strong>Use placeholders</strong>: For words or data you can't think of immediately, mark with brackets for later completion</li>
